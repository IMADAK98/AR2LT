Welcome to the AR2LT 

# Sumarry 
With more than 313 Million speakers around the world and being the fifth most spoken language in the world, Arabic language indeed is popular, but unfortunately Arabic is still falling behind in the world of technology, therefore this project is focusing mainly on developing an application that supports Arabic OCR, the application main idea is to capture Arabic words from images as input and transliterate to Latin characters as output, this shall be done using image processing techniques which will process the input image and segment each letter using a segmentation algorithm we designed after that we obtain individual sperate letters in the final step a neural network model is used to predict the letter and give the transliterated Latin character.

# Tecnolgies used:
This project was developed using Python language and several popular Python image-processing libraries such as:
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Scikit-image
* Matplotlib
